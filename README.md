# Predicting-type-of-wine
The research problem statements for this project is: 

1. Predicting the quality of white wine.(2 approach)
2.Predicting the type of wine i.e. either red wine or white wine based on the physicochemical variables.

For problem statement 1, 
predicting the quality of white wine the target label is the “Quality”. 
In this problem statement we use classification tasks to predict the quality of white wine. 
In this problem, I have done with two approach considering the target variable with scale (1-10) and other one is converting the target variable based on the distribution of data points into 3 classes i.e. low quality(1-4), medium(5,6) and high quality(7,8,9,10).

For problem statement 2, 
predicting the type of wine the target variable is “Type”. 
In this problem statement we use classification tasks to predict the type i.e. red or white wine based on the features.
